This library will be used to automate sending messages
to whatever numbers are in the numbers file. It will 
send messages via the email that is setup in the login 
file. There is currently no formatting for numbers yet
so each line in the numbers file should be 10 digits
followed by a new line. The login file contains two lines
<email address>\n
<password>
